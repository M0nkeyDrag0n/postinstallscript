# PostInstallScript - m0nkeydrag0n
Welcome to my little learning project for bash scripting.  The goal of this exercise is to create a useful bash script that can be deployed to all my linux builds, regardless of distribution.  A rudimentary menu will be part of the script along with a somewhat dynamic feel.
Included in this script were some elements that helped me in building an understanding of the abilities you can expect when writing bash scripts.  This has been an enjoyable experience and should you stumble across this tiny portion of the web, that there is a takeaway that can be used in another project.

Thank you!
